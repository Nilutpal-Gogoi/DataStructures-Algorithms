DIRECT RECURSION
> Direct recursion occurs when a function calls itself.
> This results in a one-step recursive call, meaning that the function makes a recursive
call inside its own function body.

---------------------------Syntax of Direct Recursion------------------------------
def function(p1,p2,p3,...,pn):
    # Some code here
    function(p1,p2,p3,...,pn)
    # Some code here

INDIRECT RECURSION
> Indirect recursion (also called mutual recursion) occurs when a function calls another
function until the original function is called, again.

for example, if function function1() calls another function function2(), function2()
eventually calls the original function function1() - This completes the process of
indirect recursion.

--------------------------Syntax of Indirect Recursion-------------------------
def function1(p1,p2,...,pn):
    # Some code here
    function2(p1,p2,...,pn):
    # Some code here

def function2(p1,p2,...,pn):
    # Some code here
    function1(p1,p2,...,pn):
    # Some code here
