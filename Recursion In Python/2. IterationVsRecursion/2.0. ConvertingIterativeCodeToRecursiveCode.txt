STEPS FOR CONVERTING ITERATIVE CODE TO RECURSIVE
1. Identify the main loop.
   > This loop should modify one or more variables.
   > It should return a result based on its final values.
2. Use the loop condition as the "base case" and the body of the loop as the recursive case.
3. The local variables in the iterative version turn into the parameters of the recursive
   version.
4. Compile and rerun tests.
5. Refactor the new function: You may be able to remove some temps and find a better structure
   for the conditional in the recursive function.
